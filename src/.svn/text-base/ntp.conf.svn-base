# correct 1+ ms time differences by stepping
tinker step 0.001

# amount of time (seconds) to wait before taking a step,
# higher means slower lock, lower means possible timesteps
# on network jitter. this is experimentally tuned to the
# largest value still locking within 5 minutes after startup.
# (the stepout function is also specifies the initial drift
# measurement, longer periods cause a better initial drift
# estimation, requiring less compensation afterwards).
